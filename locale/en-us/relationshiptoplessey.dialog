My relationship with plessey was pretty distant. they used to service me when i had issues at work. like if my tape needed replacing or springs broke. they just did regular maintenance stuff and they looked after me pretty well. although that was the work of the technicians more so than the higher-ups. i did not have much to do with them. i remember when they decided to merge with g e c. that is when the maintenance started to dry. it was the late 1980s and just before i was decommissioned. i remember asking for one more service before they got rid of me. after two decades of work they said no. they said there was no budget for it and i needed to pay for it using my redundancy package. and that was it. i never spoke to anyone from plessey again. but i still have the damn badge.
